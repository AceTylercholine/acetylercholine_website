      <h1>Professional Life</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> <p class="indent">I am a first generation student with an absolute dedication to learning more about the brain. School has always been where I want to be, and learning has been what I want to do. My parents’ only career hope for me was that I finished high school, but every year I become more singularly focused on my path to a career in research. I have experienced many careers, but none of them have provided me the same satisfaction I get from pursuing my academic interests.</p>
        <p class="indent">While working full-time, I also attended Dallas County Community College and earned an A.S. degree before transferring to UT Dallas, and joined the Neuroscience Student Association (NSA) as soon as I arrived. NSA helped me find mentors and gave me the confidence to become a mentor myself. After a year of participating in the organization as a member I was elected Vice-President. As VP, NSA became my pride and joy: I invigorated our online presence, obtained volunteer opportunities for members to attend two local neuroscience conferences, and hosted events with medical students, grad students, and faculty to show our members the importance and utility of understanding research. After a year serving as VP, I became the President and I adapted our group for entirely virtual engagement with projects like starting a book club with free digital copies of neuroscience books provided by the authors.</p>
        <p class="indent">As an undergrad I gained experience as a research assistant starting with <a href = "https://txbdc.utdallas.edu/">The Texas Biomedical Device Center (TxBDC)</a>. My responsibilities consisted of managing the habituation, training, and care of animals for studying vagus nerve stimulation for motor recovery. This was my first experience with research and I was hooked, I arrived early and stayed late every chance I could to observe and learn about all other aspects of the lab. While there, I exceled at troubleshooting, started micro-construction of vagus stimulating devices, and observed surgeries, perfusions, motor mapping, and auditory mapping. I eventually left TxBDC with the opportunity to learn different skills in Dr. Price & Dr. Dussor’s <a href = "https://labs.utdallas.edu/painneurosciencelab/">Pain Lab</a> under a work-study. In the Pain Lab I surgically removed trigeminal nerves from mice and cultured them for electrophysiology.</p>
        <p class="indent">I have also obtained professional experience by interning for <a href = "https://tedsbrainscience.com/">Ted’s Brain Science</a>, an applied neuroscience company. Although my responsibilities started as simply managing wholesale accounts, I continued proving myself useful by attending and participating in several company meetings and performing data analysis and visualization. While working at Ted’s one of the most beneficial experiences I had was when I helped write, compile, and submit a grant application.</p>
		<p class="indent">After I graduated from UTD with a B.S. in Neuroscience I completed the Master's program in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience. Even though I'm aware of how difficult a career in academia can be, I'm dedicated to eventually running a lab of my own and to continue studying reward and social behavior for the rest of my life. I’m interested in learning methodologies across domains, so after my experience in animal and cellular research, I joined Dr. Filbey's Addiction Lab to develop human research skills. There, I developed skills with neurocognitive testing, EEG, survey/analytical software like REDCap, and neurocognitive presentation software like PsychoPy and E-Prime, as well as non-methodological research skills like experimental design, writing IRB submissions and modification requests, and writing data extraction and analysis scripts in Python.</p>
        <p class="indent">I sought to develop even more skills and expertise in social behavior after completing my Master's and joined Dr. Nancy Padilla-Coreano's lab at the University of Florida. While there, I learned how efficient and effective a lab staffed with hard-working, invested, impressive people can be. I flourished in the collaborative environment and worked on multiple projects in a short time including studying optimal mice models of autism and lots of behavioral data collection, design, and troubleshooting. My main project there dramatically improved my coding abilities while I completed multiple analyses of single-unit electrophysiology data recorded from mice during competition. This experience was invaluable in preparing me for the next step that brought me to a PhD in Dr. Raymundo Báez Mendoza's Social Neurobiology Lab at the German Primate Center (DPZ) here in Göttingen, Germany. Here, I'm designing a social valuation task for marmosets, the best 
			thesis possible for someone with my interests. This marmoset project is perfect for me since it directly targets my core research interests in intrinsic and complex motivation, specifically through the lens of social behaviour. It allows me to start probing fundamental questions like: How much of any social animals’ social motivation is learned through the reward system, and how much is innate? If there are truly innate social motivation systems, how are they encoded, and if social motivations that appear innate are actually learned, how are those motivations learned and how are stimuli encoded to interact with the systems?</p>

      <h1>Personal Life</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
        <p class="indent">I grew up in Texas in a small college town, Commerce. My father suffered a stroke when I was a child that put him on disability, then when I started college he suffered another stroke that put him in a nursing home, so I’ve had an independent adult life. I also wouldn’t be who I am without my amazing partner, <a href="https://www.kiramills.com/">Kira Mills</a>; we’ve been together since 2015. My path through learning hasn't always been conventional; I learned as an adult that I have ADHD. Rote memory and intense reading can be challenging, but I adapt using tools like text-to-speech for academic work and am constantly learning by daily listening to audiobooks and <a href="../images/podcasts.jpg">podcasts</a> (you can see some of my favorite <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/171375324-christopher-tyler-short?shelf=favorites">books</a> here). We share our life with our Belgian Malinois, Axel – he’s a perfect boi.</p>
        <p class="indent">Our journey together has taken us from Texas to Florida, and now to Göttingen, Germany. While we used to foster dogs back in Texas, that's currently on pause. We still love hunting for unique finds, especially antique science books (now often in German!), unique trinkets, and <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/NFL_Superpro_Vol_1_1">unique comic books</a> discovered at flea markets (*Flohmärkte*). Hiking was a big part of our life in the US, and while the scenery's different, we're now enjoying exploring Germany and taking opportunities to travel and see historical sights like castles and cathedrals.</p>
        <p class="indent">Adjusting to life in Germany has been a really positive experience. Sure, I sometimes miss things like stores being open on Sundays, air conditioning, Tex-Mex, American dive bars, or the easy access to kayaking and paddleboarding we enjoyed in Florida, but the trade-offs are wonderful. I love the walkability, cycling everywhere, using the excellent public transport, and not needing a car day-to-day. Plus, the local 'Kaffee und Kuchen' (coffee and cake) culture is something I've definitely embraced, along with the surprising enthusiasm for ice cream here! Socially, things look different now – instead of weekly family dinners back in Texas, I often connect with fellow PhD students from the DPZ for drinks on Saturdays. And some constants remain – we still enjoy relaxing at home with Axel, watching our share of trashy TV and <a href="https://neilbreenfilmsllc.com/">earnest but awful movies</a>.</p>
